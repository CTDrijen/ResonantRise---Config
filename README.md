Config changes for RR. Tackling basic forestry backpacks first. 

Digger's Backpack: added raw stone from Underground Biomes. Added raw stone from BoP. Railcraft Quarried/Abyssal stone. 

Builder's Backpack: Lots here. Worked stone (bricks, patterns, stairs, slabs, metal fences/posts, walls,) from Artifice, Underground Biomes, Dartcraft, Railcraft, BoP, MFR, Tinker's Construct, Thaumcraft, ExtraUtilities. Just a massive pile of cool looking rocks. 

Forester's Backpack: Big change here is the addition of worked planks rather than just raw logs. Planks, stairs, slabs, doors, fences from Forestry, ExtraTrees, Natura, BoP. Seeds, saplings, flowers, and plants from all mods added. Fruits from Binnie's trees added. 

Hunter's Backpack: Just a few odds and ends here. Lambchops, Venison, MFR meat products. Minium Shards. 

Miner's Backpack: Railcraft Dark ores and sulfer/saltpeter. Lignite from UB since its basically coal. Regular/Nether version of Power Ore for silktouch people. BoP gem ore and blocks. ICBM sulfer. Certus Quartz ore. Moved AtomSci Uranium ore from Digger's to here.
